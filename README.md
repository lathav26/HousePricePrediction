#  House Price Prediction - Internship Task

This project is part of my internship task, where I built a **Machine Learning model** to predict house prices based on different features such as size, location, and number of rooms.

##  Project Overview
- Implemented **data preprocessing** (handling missing values, encoding, scaling).
- Explored dataset using **data visualization**.
- Built **ML models** like Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
- Evaluated models using **RÂ² score, MAE, MSE**.
- Created a **prediction script** where users can input features and get house price predictions.
